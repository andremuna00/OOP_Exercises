# 🎮 Advanced OOP Games Showcase: Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, and Tournaments 🕹️  

Welcome to the **Advanced OOP Games Showcase**, a repository that highlights Object-Oriented Programming concepts through the development of classic games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku, and a dynamic tournament system!  

This project was developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at [Ca' Foscari University](https://www.unive.it/), during the year 2020. 🏫

## 🕹️ Game Descriptions  

### 🎲 Exercise 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Engine  
🔗 **Goal**: Build a playable Tic-Tac-Toe engine, with intelligent player moves and game state management.  
📦 **Package**: `it.unive.dais.po1.exercise1`  
📌 **Core Components**:  
- `Player` class: Handles player behavior and moves.  
- `TicTacToeBoard` class: Manages the game board and determines the winner.  

---

### ♟️ Exercise 2: Gomoku Engine  
🔗 **Goal**: Extend the functionality of the board to support Gomoku.  
📦 **Package**: `it.unive.dais.po1.exercise2`  
📌 **Core Components**:  
- Abstract `Player` and `Board` classes for scalability.  
- `GomokuBoard` and `Player` classes for Gomoku-specific rules.  

---

### 🏆 Exercise 3: Tournament System  
🔗 **Goal**: Simulate competitive tournaments for Tic-Tac-Toe and Gomoku.  
📦 **Package**: `it.unive.dais.po1.exercise3`  
📌 **Core Components**:  
- Tournament logic with configurable formats.  
- Scoring and ranking through a `Standing` implementation.  
- Exception handling for robust gameplay.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  

- **Java** ☕: Core programming language for the implementation.  
- **JUnit** ✅: Testing framework for unit tests.  
- **Spring Boot** 🌱: Demo application showcasing Java's enterprise features.  

---

## 🧪 Testing  

🧪 **JUnit Tests** are available to validate each feature:  
- Board functionality tests.  
- Player strategy tests.  
- Structural integrity checks.  

Simply navigate to the `/tests` directory and run the test cases for instant feedback!
